Bulk-delete GitHub Repositorys

1. Get a Github API token (Settings -> Developer settings -> Personal Access Tokens)

2. Copy all your repos (Settings -> Repositories) and paste them into your favorite text editor

3. Use regex to filter them down to just the ones you donâ€™t want. For me that meant running the following commands in Vscode:

   - Search for demo/[a-zA-Z0-9-_]\* , i.e., where each repo was forked from: demo/

   - Use Alt+L to select all matched

4. Modify run.sh and Run it

```
sh run.sh
```
